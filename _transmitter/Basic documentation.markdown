# OpenScaleRemote Transmitter

OpenScaleRemote is a open source platform for building your own RC Transmitter and Reciever. The Transmitter can be based of lots of different boards, including various arduino, esp32 and teensy boards.

## MCU

The software of the OpenScaleRemote has support for the following boards already implemented. But you can also use any other Board with support for SPI, I2C, GPIO based interrupts and a sufficient number of analog and digital input pins.  
Due to the lack of GPIO based interrupts the RP2040 running the arduino core by earlphilflower is not supported.

Board function | Arduino MEGA 2560 | ESP32WROOM32 | Teensy4.1
-------- | -------- | -------- | --------
pin_led | LED_BUILTIN | 2 | not defined
bat_voltage | not defined | 15 | not defined

## Wireless communication

The OpenScaleRemote uses an [RFM95W LoRa module](https://www.hoperf.com/modules/lora/RFM95W.html) build by HopeRF running the [LoRa](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-LoRa) library by Sandeep Mistry. You can choose between different types of RFM95W boards. We recommend the [adafruit version](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3072), but any other board can be used too. Just make sure that it matches the logic voltage of your mcu or use a SPI capable logic level voltage converter.

## Display and UI

The UI of the OpenScaleRemote Transmitter is build with [SquareLine Studio](https://squareline.io/) running on a [2,8 inch ILI9488](https://www.az-delivery.de/en/products/2-8-zoll-lcd-tft-touch-display) based tft witch capacitive touch. It uses the [TFT_eSPI](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI) display library by Bodmer and the [lvgl](https://lvgl.io/) grafics library by kisvegabor. Make sure that the tft matches the logic voltage of your mcu or use a SPI capable logic level voltage converter.
Due too the lack of SRAM on the Arduino MEGA 2560, the SquareLine Studio based UI is not available for this mcu.

## Model data storage

The OpenScaleRemote Transmitter uses a SD-Card to store model spezific data such as name, servo directions and servo limits. Any SD or MicroSD card module can be used here.
